Linda Hayes, Worksoft, Inc.
---------------------------

Learn how to accelerate your test automation effort, dramatically shorten the learning curve, allow non-technical analysts to develop and execute automated tests, and even simplify test library management and maintenance. Linda Hayes presents a guided tour through six levels of test automation, from beginner to advanced implementation approaches, with analyses of the advantages and disadvantages of each. The course provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for how to select and implement a framework. Learn how to use this practical and proven table-driven approach with any commercial or internally developed testing tool for Web, client/server, mainframe, and character-based applications. Linda provides real world examples, new knowledge, and skills you can use as the framework for a new automation project or to make an existing project more successful.
